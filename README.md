## Description:
This is a physics engine that i am working on on the side just for the fun of it 
hoping it will be a nice learning experience and some nice things can be accomplished.

## Segment-Segment minimum distance implementation:

## TO DO:

- Implement GJK collision detection which allows for collision detection between convex hulls

- Add some collision response by calculating some collision info within GJK for example (EPA)

- Implement mesh collider collision detection

- Implement Capsule collider collision detection

- Implement raycasting 

- Refactor and revisit the architecture 

- Implement some actual physics behavior such as kinematics and forces etc...

- Implement rigidbody physics

- Implement joint physics

## PS:
NAME OF ENGINE TBD

- ATM thinking of the matrix engine (MTRX-ENGINE) or smthg like that
