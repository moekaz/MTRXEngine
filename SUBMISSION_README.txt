This is the final submission of my honour's project which includes the following:

- Honour's project report (located at the root dir)
- Documentation either via an html link by opening the index.html file or the pdf generated from the latex code (located in: documentation/)
- 4 demos: A projectile demo, collision demo, buoyancy demo, and a fluid simulation demo (located under: MTRXEngine\MTRXEngine\demos)
- The codebase of the physics engine, the libraries, renderer, and demo source code (located under: MTRXEngine/MTRXEngine/source/)
The main codebase of the engine is located under "headers/ and code/". The entire project can be opened in visual studio using the .sln file
located in the MTRXEngine/ directory. The entry point of the project is the "PhysicsDemo.cpp" file with a preprocessor define for which demo to run
(1 -> projectile demo, 2 -> Collision Demo, 3 -> Buoyancy Demo, 4 -> Fluid Simulation Demo)
